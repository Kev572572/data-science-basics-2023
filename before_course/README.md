# Getting set up

During this workshop, we will be using R and R Studio. Please download R and R Studio to the laptop you plan to use during the workshop *before* the first day of the workshop (Mac, Windows, or Linux laptops are all ok). This will allow us to move more quickly through the workshop material more efficiently as a group. Please come each day with a fully-charged laptop. 

Don't worry if you run into issues! We will set aside some time to resolve any issues on the first day of class. If you do not have access to a working laptop or are not able to install R or R Studio, you are still more than welcome to attend the workshop and follow along with the materials.
