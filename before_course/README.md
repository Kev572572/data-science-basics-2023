# Getting set up

During this workshop, we will be using R and R Studio. If you are able to, please download R and R Studio to the laptop you plan to use during the workshop *before* the first day of the workshop. This will allow us to move more quickly through the workshop material more efficiently as a group.

Don't worry if you run into issues! We will set aside some time to resolve any issues on the first day of class. If you do not have access to a working laptop or are not able to install R or R Studio, you are still more than welcome to attend the workshop and follow along with the materials.
