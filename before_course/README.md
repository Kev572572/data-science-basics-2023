# Getting set up

During this workshop, we will be using R and R Studio. Please download both R and R Studio *before* the first day of the workshop on the laptop you plan to use (Mac, Windows, or Linux laptops are all ok). This will allow us to move through the workshop material more efficiently as a group. Also -- please come each day with a fully-charged laptop.

Don't worry if you run into issues! We will set aside some time to try to resolve any issues on the first day of class. If you do not have access to a working laptop, or are not able to install R or R Studio, you are still more than welcome to attend the workshop and follow along with the materials.

### Install R

Download R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Install RStudio Desktop

Download RStudio Desktop [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).

If you'd like some additional support downloading either R or RStudio Desktop, please see the online book ["An Introduction to R"](https://intro2r.com/installing-rstudio.html), which contains some information on getting set up, including helpful videos.
